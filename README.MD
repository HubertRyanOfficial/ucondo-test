# uCondo Test (Mobile)

In this project you will have a **list of accounts**, with this list you can organize categories and subcategories depending on whether the category receives releases. Each category has its limit of 999 subcategories, after which it will create a new category. <br/>**by Hubert Ryan!**

## About ✍

With **React Native**, using the **React Navigation** to create, edit and main app entry.
All data is stored locally, without needing to login or register, the entire state structure was configured with **redux** and **redux-persist**, thus being able to persist data without a server.
For the components, the **styled-components** library was used, making them easier to manipulate.

This **layout design** was completely developed from scratch to be a **realistic and original** application for anyone who is going to clone and use it.

## Dependencies 🔧

Below are all the **dependencies** that were used for this project to be completed. These libraries were enough to make a project like this work.

- [x] Async Storage
- [x] React Native Picker
- [x] React Navigation
- [x] Redux
- [x] React Redux
- [x] Redux Persist
- [x] Styled Components

> Important: The entire redux structure is configured in the folder `src/config/store`.
